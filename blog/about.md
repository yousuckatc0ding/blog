Iâ€™m Akash, a developer who loves experimenting with new languages and building cool stuff. Lately, Iâ€™ve been endlessly tinkering with my Neovim config and playing around with Tmux.


Right now, Iâ€™m also coding this blog from scratchâ€”built with a FastAPI backend and a TailwindCSS + HTML + Jinja2 frontend (anything to avoid JS ðŸ˜›).
